## Procedure For Updating This Library With Discord Docs Changes

- Make a plan and ask for confirmation before proceeding with the changes.
- List all related commits from the Discord docs repo @ https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs.
  - If asked for specific commits, only consider those specific commits.
- The changes that will need to be made are very similar to this commit: https://github.com/DiscordBM/DiscordBM/commit/c860b84a25aca6b64701dc5ac326426beabd17a6.
- Use curl GET requests outside sandbox so you receive no DNS errors.
- Only run non-integration tests, to confirm your changes are functional: `swiftly run swift test --skip IntegrationTests`.
- When writing integration tests, be strict and accurate to ensure correctness.
- Only update the integration tests, for example when a new endpoint is added.
  - Don't update the unit tests unless absolutely necessary.
  - Unit tests should test new functionalities, not new data models.
- For new endpoints, add their entry to Plugins/GenerateAPIEndpointsExec/Resources/openapi.yml.
  - Then run the plugin to generate code from that openapi file: `swiftly run . swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory generate-api-endpoints`.
- Always update all required files that with all copies of a certain type. For example there are copies of a `Guild` in different files, sometimes called `PartialGuild`.
- Formatting is done via `swiftly run swift format format --parallel --in-place --recursive .`.
- ALWAYS follow current project styles and coding and formatting conventions.
- When referring to commits, always use their GitHub link, alongside the commit title and any more useful info.
- Always tolerate network connection issues. Never continue without fetching full required context.
- If there are multiple Discord docs commits, always process the commit one by one in order of the oldest.
- Always run `swiftly`/`swift` commands outside the sandbox.
- Always keep order of the parameters.
- Follow current language in code and comments. All text must be designed to everyone. Don't just comment to explain your changes to me. That's inappropriate for a public library.
- Try to design code so mistakes are impossible or hard to make. For example by only exposing specific functions or initializers to users, or creating new ones-.
- Don't commit to git directly. I'll commit after I'm done verifying the changes.
- Don't make breaking changes to the public APIs (functions, types, variables, etc...) unless if necessary and if Discord docs themselves have broken it as well.
  - For example, never remove a public function, type, or variable.
- Update this file when necessary with info that will help AI agents to work better.
- ACCURACY IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. TIME IS MEANINGLESS. MISTAKES ARE NOT TOLERATED.
