/// A macro to stabilize enums that might get more cases, to some extent.
/// The main goal is to not fail json decodings if Discord adds a new case.
///
/// This is supposed to be used with enums that are supposed to be raw-representable.
/// The macro accepts one and only one of these types as a generic argument:
/// `String`, `Int`, `UInt`. More types can be added on demand.
/// The generic argument represents the `RawValue` of a `RawRepresentable` type.
/// You can manually declare the raw value of a case, using a comment in front of it like so:
/// ```swift
/// case something // "actually nothing!"
/// case anything // still nothing!
///
/// case value12 // 12
/// ```
///
/// How it manipulates the code:
/// Adds `RawRepresentable` conformance where `RawValue` is the generic argument of the macro.
/// Adds a new `.__undocumented(RawValue)` case.
/// which can too easily result in code breakage.
/// If `Decodable`, adds a slightly-modified `init(from:)` initializer.
/// If `CaseIterable`, repairs the `static var allCases` requirement.
